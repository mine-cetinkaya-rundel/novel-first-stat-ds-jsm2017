## Abstract

For some students the first course in statistics may be the only quantitative reasoning course they take in college. For others, it is the first of many in a statistics major curriculum. The content of this course depends on which audience the course is aimed at as well as its place in the curriculum. However a data-centric approach with an emphasis on computation and algorithmic thinking is essential for all modern first statistics courses. The speakers in this session will present their approaches for the various first courses in statistics and data science that they have developed and taught. This discussion will also highlight pedagogical and curricular choices they have made in deciding what to keep, what to eliminate, and what to modify from the traditional introductory statistics curriculum.
